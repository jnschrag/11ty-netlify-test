GNDEM, which also accepts new members, is currently made up of 251 member organizations in 89 countries and territories, and nine regional network members in Africa, Asia, Europe and Eurasia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East/North Africa. Members and regional networks form this global network in order to better meet challenges for achieving genuinely democratic elections and to further our common aspirations for representative, responsive, transparent, democratic governance.
