  Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring
  by Citizen Organizations
---

Setting forth a clear and forceful statement of principles and code of conduct for nonpartisan election monitoring by citizen organizations marks a major milestone in the development of nonpartisan election monitoring around the world. The Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations and its code of conduct do just that. All GNDEM members must endorse and implement the Declaration.

The Declaration provides an important set of standards for self-awareness and accountability among nonpartisan election monitoring organizations. It provides a basis of understanding upon which nonpartisan organizations can engage with electoral officials and other governmental authorities. It also allows citizens, news media and concerned members of the international community to appreciate the role and commitment of organizations that endorse the Declaration of Global Principles.

The Declaration of Global Principles sets forth the basis and rationale for citizen action to monitor and promote the integrity of elections. It defines the activities and delineates ethical obligations concerning impartiality, independence, accuracy, transparency, nondiscrimination, respect for the rule of law and cooperation with other electoral stakeholders and international election observers. It describes the processes monitored and conditions required for successful nonpartisan election monitoring by citizens. It sets forth specific pledges and commitments of the endorsing organizations and provides for a second type of endorsement by “Supporters of the Declaration” for international organizations that support or are concerned with nonpartisan election monitoring by citizen organizations. The accompanying code of conduct operationalizes the Declaration and provides a sample nonpartisan pledge.

The Declaration of Global Principles was developed through a consensus process by representatives of the existing and developing regional networks of nonpartisan election monitoring organizations from Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia, Latin American America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa that are members of GNDEM. The representatives formed a Draft Development Group (DDG) that reviewed a large body of relevant materials in advance of a 24-25 May 2010 meeting in Johannesburg. A Draft was produced as a consequence of that meeting and circulated for comment to the over 125 GNDEM members. Comments were reviewed by the DDG and a final text was presented to the respective regional networks for consideration before it was opened for endorsements by domestic election monitoring organizations. The process surrounding development of the Declaration of Global Principles was facilitated by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and the UN Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD).

## Preamble

Genuine democratic elections are the peoples' collective expression of sovereignty and an inalienable right of citizens. These precepts are recognized in national constitutions the world over and in international human rights instruments of the United Nations, regional intergovernmental organizations and other bodies.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 21 states that: "The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedures." Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, a treaty among 165 countries at this date) states that: "Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 \[that is, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status\] and without unreasonable restrictions: … To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors…." The election related rights set forth and opportunities called for in those two articles are based on their explicit recognition that every citizen has the right to take part in government and public affairs, either directly or through freely chosen representatives.

Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations has emerged as one of the most tangible and significant dimensions of democratic development around the globe. In more than 90 countries on five continents over the last two decades, millions of citizens have joined non-partisan election observation and monitoring efforts to ensure electoral integrity and promote accountability in government and among political contestants. This has contributed to safeguarding genuine elections, mitigating potentials for conflict, and promoting accountability and democratic development.

Non-partisan observation and monitoring of elections by citizen organizations is part of participating in public affairs, which "relates to legislative, executive and administrative powers" and "covers all aspects of public administration, and the formulation and implementation of policy…."(UNHRC General Comment 25, paragraph 5.) Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations exercises the right of association that is central to the functioning of nongovernmental organizations, as well as the right to seek, receive and impart information that is vital to transparency and is included in the freedom of expression protected by articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR. Establishing an election process that is open to citizen examination is essential because citizens not only have the right to genuine elections, they have the right to know whether the election process provided an opportunity for free expression of the will of the electors and accurately recorded and honored the electors' will.

Non-partisan citizen election observers and monitors can be considered as specialized human rights defenders focused on civil and political rights, which are central to achieving genuine elections. Genuine elections require respect for the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including association, peaceful assembly, expression, media freedom, movement, security of person, equal protection of the law for prospective voters and those seeking to be elected, as well as providing effective remedies when electoral related rights are violated.

These electoral related rights and freedoms, and related rule of law issues, are affected by a range of institutions and processes over a lengthy period of time that makes up an election cycle and are woven into the fabric of each country's political process and historical context. At the same time, elections allow citizens to aggregate their interests to demand that those seeking office address issues related to economic, social and cultural well being, as well as peace and security. Genuine elections therefore are not only a condition to establishing democratic governance; they are inseparable from broader democratic development.

With the exercise of rights come responsibilities, and non-partisan domestic election observers and monitors have an ethical obligation to conduct their activities in a responsible manner. Various international publications and the charters of individual domestic non-partisan election observation and monitoring organizations and their cross-border networks emphasize that non-partisanship requires impartiality, accuracy and professionalism.

Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations requires the highest ethical standards for impartiality and accuracy based on credible methodologies that incorporate best practices that are suitable to national conditions. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring seeks to enhance electoral integrity by deterring and exposing irregularities and fraud, deterring and mitigating potentials for election-related violence and offering recommendations for improving electoral and political processes. It seeks to promote public confidence as the election process warrants and to promote citizen participation in government and public affairs through electoral processes that are free of proscribed discrimination and unreasonable restrictions.

Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations seeks to cooperate with election management bodies and other governmental authorities related to election processes and makes observations, assessments and findings based on the national legal framework and obligations concerning democratic elections that are set forth in international human rights instruments, as well as standards, principles and commitments presented in international and regional charters, conventions, declarations and other such documents.

The quality of an election process typically reflects the democratic character of governance leading to an election and can be an important indicator of the nature of government that results from an election. The skills and networks developed in non-partisan election observation and monitoring have allowed citizens across the globe not only to sustain their on-going electoral integrity activities, but also to strengthen and expand their monitoring, advocacy and accountability efforts to promote representative, transparent and accountable democratic governance.

**Therefore:**

**_Recognizing_** that non-partisan election observation and monitoring is a growing trend around the world, reaching thus far over 90 countries on five continents and mobilizing millions of citizens to participate in public affairs,

**_Acknowledging_** that non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations can be considered as a specialized form of human rights defending that focuses on civil and political rights, which are central to achieving genuine elections, the rule of law and democratic governance,

**_Noting_** that non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations can contribute significantly to deterring and mitigating potentials for election related violence, and that activities by non-partisan election observation and monitoring organizations can contribute significantly to improving the democratic quality of legal frameworks for elections, the conduct of election processes and broader democratic development,

**_Appreciating_** that election management bodies and other government authorities have the crucial responsibility to organize genuine democratic elections, that political parties and candidates have a right to seek to be elected, that citizens have the right to vote and to participate fully in election and political processes and that non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations has a distinct role to play in the independent scrutiny of electoral processes,

**_Affirming_** that the conduct of non-partisan election observation and monitoring creates responsibilities to other citizens, including prospective voters, those seeking to be elected and those responsible for administering election processes and those charged with adjudicating electoral disputes,

**_Emphasizing_** that genuine democratic elections provide the means to resolve peacefully the competition for political power and provide the basis for citizens to express their will as to who shall have the authority to govern, as recognized in article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the ICCPR,

**_Appreciating_** that the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) in General Comment 25, paragraphs 5, 8, and 20, has declared to the 165 state parties to the ICCPR that the right to participate in public affairs is a broad concept whereby citizens take part through public debate, dialogue and their capacity to organize themselves, and the Committee has affirmed that: "There should be independent scrutiny of the voting and counting processes … so that electors have confidence…." that their elections are genuine,

**_Affirming_** that independent scrutiny of election administration, and the other processes surrounding elections, encompasses non-partisan observation and monitoring of elections by citizen organizations, which is distinct from judicial review and scrutiny by political parties, candidates or their agents,

**_Acknowledging_** that the charters, conventions, declarations and other instruments of regional intergovernmental organizations, as well as documents of nongovernmental organizations, also recognize the right to genuine democratic elections and that a number of instruments explicitly support non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations, including, for example, paragraph 8 of the OCSE's 1990 Copenhagen Document and paragraph 22 of the 2007 African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, and

**_Recognizing_** that many of the principles of non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations are common to those of international election observation set forth in the 2005 _Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation_, which has been endorsed as of this date by 39 intergovernmental and international nongovernmental organizations and which was recognized with appreciation by the United Nations General Assembly (A/Res/64/155; 8 March 2010), and therefore adopting paragraphs 1 through 3 of that declaration as paragraphs 1 through 3 of this declaration and otherwise noting harmony between the two declarations,

The organizations endorsing this Declaration of Global Principles for Non-partisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations and the accompanying Code of Conduct for Non-partisan Citizen Election Observers and Monitors hereby join to declare:

### Genuine Democratic Elections

1. Genuine democratic elections are an expression of sovereignty, which belongs to the people of a country, the free expression of whose will provides the basis for the authority and legitimacy of government. The rights of citizens to vote and to be elected at periodic, genuine democratic elections are internationally recognized human rights. Genuine democratic elections are central for maintaining peace and stability, and they provide the mandate for democratic governance.
2. In accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ICCPR and other international instruments, everyone has the right and must be provided with the opportunity to participate in the government and public affairs of his or her country, without any discrimination prohibited by international human rights principles and without any unreasonable restrictions. This right can be exercised directly, by participating in referenda, standing for elected office and by other means, or can be exercised through freely chosen representatives.
3. The will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections, which guarantee the right and opportunity to vote freely and to be elected fairly through universal and equal suffrage by secret balloting or equivalent free voting procedures, the results of which are accurately counted, announced and respected. A significant number of rights and freedoms, processes, laws and institutions are therefore involved in achieving genuine democratic elections.

### Non-partisan, Independent Scrutiny of Electoral Processes

1.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is the mobilization of citizens in a politically neutral, impartial and non-discriminatory manner to exercise their right of participation in public affairs by witnessing and reporting on electoral developments through: independent, systematic and comprehensive evaluation of legal frameworks, institutions, processes and the political environment related to elections; impartial, accurate and timely analysis of findings; the characterization of the findings based on the highest ethical standards for impartiality and accuracy; the offering of appropriate recommendations for obtaining genuine democratic elections; and advocating for improvements in legal frameworks for elections, their implementation through electoral related administration and removal of impediments to full citizen participation in electoral and political processes.
2.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is impartial towards all political parties, candidates and those in favor of or opposed to any issue or initiative presented in a referendum. It is politically neutral and concerned with electoral outcomes only in determining the degree to which they are the result of a genuinely democratic process and are reported transparently, accurately and in a timely manner.
3.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations seeks to work in cooperation with election management bodies, other governmental agencies and other electoral stakeholders and does not obstruct election processes or officials, electoral contestants or voters. Non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations should meet with electoral and other governmental authorities and other electoral stakeholders to seek, receive or provide information and to offer recommendations for improving electoral and political processes.
4.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is independent of government, including electoral authorities, and is conducted for the benefit of the people of a country in order to promote and safeguard the right of citizens to participate in government and public affairs directly or through freely chosen representatives elected in genuine democratic elections.
5.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring organizations should be transparent about their funding and must not accept funding from any source or upon any condition that creates a conflict of interest that would hinder the organization from conducting its monitoring activities in a nondiscriminatory, impartial, accurate and timely manner. No one should be allowed to be a non-partisan citizen election observer or monitor unless she or he is free from any political, economic or other conflicts of interest that would hinder that person from conducting her or his election observation and monitoring activities in a nondiscriminatory, impartial, accurate and timely manner.
6.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations gathers systematically when practicable and always evaluates impartially information concerning all elements of an electoral process, including factors that may affect the overall electoral environment. This may be done through comprehensive non-partisan observation and monitoring by one citizen organization, a coalition of organizations or coordinated efforts of organizations, and it may be done through the efforts of several organizations operating more or less independently of each other, including those that choose to examine a particular process or element of the election cycle through specialized non-partisan monitoring techniques. In order to avoid confusion about observation and monitoring findings and unnecessary duplication of efforts, non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations should seek to achieve the highest degree of cooperation and potentials for coordination that are appropriate to the national circumstances.
7.  The decision by citizen organizations to observe and/or monitor an election or any element of it does not indicate that the organizations either presume the election process to be credible or to lack credibility; non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations seeks to evaluate the process and its elements accurately, impartially and as systematically as practicable in order to properly characterize processes according to national legal requirements and applicable international obligations and commitments. Non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations should make every effort to ensure that their activities are not interpreted as legitimizing a clearly undemocratic electoral process, including making public statements to prevent such misinterpretations; this includes terminating observation and monitoring activities where necessary and stating publicly the basis for that action.
8.  Organizations endorsing this Declaration recognize that substantial progress has been made internationally, including through regional organizations, international nongovernmental organizations and scholarly pursuits, in establishing standards, principles, obligations, commitments and best practices concerning genuine democratic elections; organizations endorsing this Declaration commit themselves to become familiar with and use such benchmarks to best inform their analysis, conclusions, characterizations and recommendations, and they pledge to be transparent concerning the benchmarks they use in their observation and monitoring activities.
9.  Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations includes the responsibility to issue regularly public reports, statements and releases that are accurate, impartial and timely and that present observations, analysis, findings and recommendations for improving electoral processes. When observation and monitoring is limited to one element or a limited number of elements of an election process, the related public statements should clearly state so. In addition to analyzing impartially reports of direct observations by non-partisan citizen election observers and monitors, non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations may draw upon credible evaluations of electoral processes conducted by other non-partisan citizen organizations, academics, international organizations and similar sources; where such sources serve as a principal basis for a finding or conclusion the sources should be identified.
10. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations employs a variety of methodologies and techniques, depending on the aspect of the election process and/or electoral environment being evaluated, and strives to employ the best and most systematic methodologies and techniques, in accordance with established principles and suited to the national circumstances, in order to produce observations, findings, analysis and conclusions that are accurate, impartial and as timely as practicable.
11. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations may employ statistically based methodologies for evaluating the integrity of pre-election, post-election and election-day procedures, including verifying the accuracy of electoral results through methodologies often referred to as parallel vote tabulations (PVTs), quick counts or similar terms. Decisions about the timing of reports, statements and releases concerning findings and conclusions based on such methodologies must carefully consider: the credibility of observer reports; the sufficiency of the information received; and the accuracy of analysis of the statistical data, as well as electoral rules concerning the timing of reports. Such reports should include information about statistical samples and margins of error of the findings.
12. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations can contribute significantly to deterring and mitigating potentials for election related violence and to improving legal frameworks for elections, the conduct of electoral and political processes and broader democratic development. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring organizations therefore have a responsibility, where practicable, to advocate for peaceful electoral and political processes, improvements in legal frameworks for elections and electoral administration, accountability in electoral and political processes, removal of barriers to electoral participation by women, youth, indigenous peoples and other marginalized populations, as well as to promote citizen participation in public affairs.

### Processes Observed or Monitored and Conditions Required

1. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations employs in its best practice long-term observation and analysis that address all parts of the election cycle as well as the broader political context that affects the character and quality of elections. Where non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations cannot examine every element of a given election process, they should consider the significance of pre-election and post-election factors and place election-day processes in the proper context of the election cycle as well as the related political environment. This is required in order not to over-emphasize election-day developments and thus potentially mischaracterize the nature of the election process.
2. The following are examples of elements of the electoral process that should be evaluated, though it may not be feasible to observe/monitor all of them in a specific election:
   1. the content and implementation of the legal framework, made up of the constitution, laws, treaty obligations and other international commitments, rules and regulations relating to elections;
   2. the impartiality, transparency and effectiveness of electoral administration and related governmental activities;
   3. the processes for appointing and retaining members of election management bodies;
   4. the delimitation of election district boundaries;
   5. the registration of political parties, candidates and referendum initiatives and their qualification for the ballot;
   6. the compliance of political parties with legal obligations and other requirements concerning matters such as selection of candidates, campaigning and upholding codes of conduct;
   7. the procedures relating to political party and candidate financing, campaign spending and oversight of both;
   8. the incidence of international interference in the electoral process, through proscribed financial contributions to electoral contestants, international media bias or other activities;
   9. the use of state resources in the electoral context, including their politically impartial applications and their improper use for the electoral advantage of particular political parties, candidates or supporters or opponents of referendum initiatives;
   10. the application of anti-corruption laws and other safeguards in the electoral context, including protections for "whistleblowers" who expose election related corruption;
   11. the conduct of security forces and civil servants in administrative matters, such as the issuance of permits and permissions for use of meeting places and locations for peaceful assemblies and campaign activities, such as rallies and marches, as well as the posting of campaign materials;
   12. the requirements and practices regarding access to the mass communications media for political parties, candidates and supporters or opponents of referendum initiatives;
   13. the requirements and practices concerning reporting by state controlled, public and private media about political parties, candidates and supporters or opponents of referendum initiatives, including monitoring the amount and quality of coverage of electoral contestants and coverage of issues that are pertinent to voter choices in elections or referenda;
   14. the ability of political parties, candidates and supporters and opponents of referendum initiatives to campaign freely for the support of prospective voters;
   15. the ability of prospective voters, including indigenous peoples and other traditionally marginalized populations, to seek and receive (including in minority languages) accurate and adequate information upon which to make electoral choices;
   16. the ability of eligible persons to register to vote and have their required information appear accurately on the voter registry and voter lists;
   17. the ability of prospective voters, those seeking to be elected and their supporters to be free of violence, intimidation, bribery and retaliation for their electoral choices, including whether effective and equal protection of the law is provided by police, other security forces, prosecutors and courts;
   18. the adequacy of voter education, particularly by state agencies, including among other things where, when, how and why to register and to vote, as well as of guarantees for secrecy of the ballot;
   19. the appropriateness of locations of polling places and adequacy of their facilities;
   20. the production and distribution to polling stations and recollection and storage of ballots and other sensitive election materials;
   21. the policy making process and each stage of implementing decisions concerning the use of electronic technologies in creation and execution of voter registries, electronic voting, tabulation of results and other sensitive electoral procedures;
   22. the sustainability, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of electoral technologies;
   23. the conduct of voting, including in minority languages, counting, tabulation and announcement of results, including transparency of procedures and adequacy of safeguards against inaccuracies and malfeasance;
   24. the conduct of procedures and processes concerning electoral complaints and challenges by citizens, prospective voters, those seeking election and those supporting or opposing referendum initiatives, including the provision of effective remedies for violations of electoral related rights;
   25. the conduct of administrative, civil and criminal processes concerning alleged violations of laws and regulations regarding electoral related rights and responsibilities, including application of appropriate penalties; and
   26. the development of changes to electoral related laws, rules, regulations and administrative procedures preceding and following elections.
3. In order for non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations to be conducted successfully, several conditions should be present, including, among others:
   1. security conditions allow non-partisan citizen observers and monitors to evaluate processes without substantial risk to their safety, the safety of their families or their economic well being;
   2. election management bodies and other governmental authorities concerned with electoral related processes honor the right to participate in government and public affairs by providing non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations access to polling stations and all other election related facilities and processes in the pre-election, election-day and post-election periods, including by providing accreditation, where it is required for access, in a timely manner, without proscribed discrimination or unreasonable restrictions, such as providing less access than allowed to international election observers, the media or political party and candidate observers;
   3. election management bodies and other governmental authorities provide electoral transparency through timely access to information, including election results recorded at polling stations as well as aggregated results at higher levels of electoral administration, and by allowing scrutiny of electoral related activities;
   4. political parties, candidates and groups supporting or opposing referendum initiatives provide timely information about complaints they file concerning violations of their electoral rights and the electoral challenges they lodge;
   5. non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations can exercise the freedom to associate with other organizations, both domestic and international, and cooperate with and/or receive assistance and support from them, including financial assistance, in order to pursue non-partisan election observation/monitoring activities;
   6. non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations are free to seek, receive and impart information, domestically and across borders, via verbal communications and printed or electronic media, including the Internet;
   7. national and international organizations, agencies, foundations and others that commit to provide funding and/or other assistance for non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations do so in a timely and practical manner that makes it possible in light of national conditions to employ the most systematic election observation and monitoring methodologies practicable and to integrate them into the capacities of the citizen organizations; and
   8. election management bodies, other governmental authorities, funders and other supporters recognize and honor the premise that the information gathered, analysis performed and conclusions developed by non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations belong to the respective citizen non-partisan observation and monitoring organizations, and those organizations are responsible for determining in light of legal requirements the timing and manner for presenting their findings and recommendations.

The degree to which these conditions are not present will impact the potential for successful non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations. The lack of adequate security for deployment of observers/monitors or not being provided accreditation and access to electoral facilities or other factors may prevent systematic scrutiny of election processes. Non-partisan observation and monitoring organizations may nonetheless decide to partially deploy observers/monitors, gather information from outside polling stations and/or other facilities or otherwise compensate for restrictive conditions, while identifying the restrictions, their causes and probable impact on their activities.

### Pledges and Commitments

1. In order to more effectively safeguard genuine democratic elections based on universal and equal suffrage and to respect the right to participate in public affairs, the organizations endorsing this Declaration pledge to foster the participation of all segments of the population, including indigenous peoples, national minorities, youth and the equal participation of women, as observers, monitors and leaders of their organizations.
2. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations should evaluate whether electoral related processes are free of discrimination proscribed by the national legal framework and the country's international human rights obligations, including whether equality before the law and equal protection of the law is honored in the electoral context, so that universal and equal suffrage of electors and those seeking election are safeguarded. The organizations endorsing this Declaration pledge to include findings and recommendations in their reports concerning the participation in election processes of women, youth, indigenous peoples, national minorities and other traditionally underrepresented portions of the population, such as, those with disabilities and internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as concerning steps taken by authorities, electoral contestants and other actors to encourage full participation of such groups and/or to remove barriers to their participation, including those affecting voter registration, candidate selection and qualification, voting and receiving accurate and adequate information in minority languages in order to make informed electoral choices.
3. The non-partisan citizen election observation and monitoring organizations endorsing this Declaration commit to:
   1. ensure that all of their leaders and participants, including non-partisan citizen observers/monitors, fully understand and pledge to uphold the requirements of impartiality, accuracy and timeliness in all of their election monitoring activities;

## Code of Conduct for Non-partisan Citizen Election observers and Monitors

### Introduction

Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is increasingly accepted around the world as a standard practice for supporting and safeguarding electoral integrity, promoting public confidence in democratic elections and mitigating potentials for election-related violence. Governments, including their election management bodies, those seeking to be elected and other electoral stakeholders have recognized that non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is an integral part of exercising the right of citizens to participate in government and public affairs, which is an internationally recognized human right. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations is noted by intergovernmental organizations and various intergovernmental charters, declarations and other instruments as an important aspect of promoting genuine democratic elections.

The purpose of non-partisan election observation and monitoring is to help ensure the integrity of the election process, by witnessing and reporting accurately and impartially on each aspect of the process to evaluate whether it is conducted in an open and transparent manner and in conformance with the national constitution, laws and electoral regulations, treaty obligations and other international commitments concerning democratic elections. Non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations also seeks to ensure the integrity of the election process by calling on all electoral actors (including the candidates, political parties, those supporting or opposing referendum initiatives, election officials, other governmental authorities, mass media and voters) to respect the laws and election-related rights of all citizens and to hold accountable those who violate the law and any person's election-related rights. In addition, non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations seeks to mobilize citizens in the exercise of their right to participate in public affairs as non-partisan election observers and monitors and to promote citizen participation more broadly in elections and political processes.

Along with the recognition of rights related to non-partisan election observation and monitoring by citizen organizations come responsibilities. These responsibilities may be outlined in a code of conduct to be adopted, along with a pledge of non-partisanship, by every observation and monitoring organization. Rights and responsibilities of observers and monitors also may be adopted as operating principles of an organization in formats other than codes of conduct.

The organizations and networks that endorse the Declaration of Global Principles for Non-partisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations subscribe to and follow this Code of Conduct in addition to any similar code of conduct and operating principles of their individual organization or network. Each commits to require that all of its participants, including leaders, staff, trainers, consultants and all observers and monitors adhere to this Code of Conduct, or a substantially identical one of the organization or network, and sign a Non-partisan Election Observation and Monitoring Pledge substantially identical to the one presented below.

### Modes of Conduct

In order to achieve these goals and purposes of non-partisan election observation and monitoring, each organization and network agrees that it will:

1.

## Acknowledgements

This Declaration of Global Principles for Non-partisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations and Code of Conduct for Non-partisan Citizen Election Observers and Monitors is the product of a process initiated through the Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) and facilitated by the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the UN Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD). The process included representatives from the existing regional networks of domestic non-partisan domestic election monitoring organizations and initiatives to develop such networks where they did not yet exist formally.

The representatives formed a Draft Development Group that reviewed a considerable body of preparatory materials, including relevant treaties and regional charters, declarations and other documents and the 2005 _Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation_ and its accompanying code of conduct. The Draft Development Group then met in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 24-25 May 2010, and subsequently produced the 25 May 2010 Johannesburg Draft Declaration of Principles for Non-partisan Election Observation by Citizen Organizations and Code of Conduct for Non-partisan Citizen Election Observers and Monitors (Draft Declaration). The meeting was co-hosted by the Southern Africa Development Community Election Support Network (SADC-ESN), GNDEM and NDI.

The Draft Declaration was then circulated to all 125 members of GNDEM at that time for comments and proposed changes. Each regional network of domestic election monitors distributed the Draft Declaration to its members, while GNDEM distributed it to GNDEM members that are not part of a regional network. The respective networks collected and consolidated comments and the Draft Development Group reviewed all comments, evaluated them and made appropriate changes to the Draft Declaration. The revised text was considered by the representatives of the networks and consensus was reached on the final text.

Members of the GNDEM Draft Development Group included:

Africa
